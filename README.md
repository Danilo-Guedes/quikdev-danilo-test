# quikdev-danilo-test

this is a test for fullstack developer in Quikdev made in a weekend

This is a fullstack application built with Vite + React in the front-end and Node.js + Express in the back-end.

## Front-end

The front-end of this application is developed using Vite and React. Vite is a fast build tool for modern web development, and React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Back-end

The back-end of this application is developed using Node.js and Express. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side, and Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

## Getting Started

> :warning: **WARNING**: This monorepo requires Node.js v18+. Please ensure you have this version installed before proceeding.

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danilo-Guedes/quikdev-danilo-test.git
```

2. Make the run.sh executable by doing...

```bash
chmod +x run.sh

```

3. Run the script.

```bash
./run.sh
```

4. Open the browser at http://localhost:5173/ (default port for vite apps).

5. Start use the application.

## What I would do if I had more time ?

1. Adopt a DDD or Clean Architecture approach to prepare the code for healthy growth.
2. As you create the domain entities, make better use of OOP.
3. Change the fake_bucket to a real implementation of cloud file storage.
4. Create a class to standardize backend errors.
5. If it were a real project, I would be using TypeScript instead of vanilla JavaScript.
6. I would put all the code into a container so the development enviroment get easier to setup.
